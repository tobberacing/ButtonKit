# Buttons Kit by 44

An easy to use collection of buttons for both designers and iOS developers. As a designer you get a Sketch document with symbols for the common button variations. As a developer you get a toolkit written in Swift that supports the a vast variety of modern UI patterns. Since both designers and developers gets editable versions (symbols and code), you can view this kit as a starting point for further development through your own extensions, should you want to.  


# Quick-start guide

## For Designers

- Download the Sketch file
- Add buttons as symbols to your Sketch documents

## For Developers

- Add the Swift Package dependency through Xcode from `https://github.com/tobberacing/ButtonsKit.git`
- Use the `Button` class either through IB or programmatically 


# Designers

The Sketch file contains symbols for primary, secondary, plain and destructive buttons, ready to be thrown in to your project, resting assured that your developers wonâ€™t need to build anything from scratch.

The symbols include designs for four different styles, with five different layouts and two sizes each. All buttons include a spinner state.


## 1. Styles

![Available button styles](/Documentation/1.png)

Buttons come in four main styles. A primary filled version, a secondary bordered, a plain with only text and a destructive one.


## 2. Layouts

![Available button styles](/Documentation/2.png)

Each style supports five different layouts for different purposes. Two for additional detail, one with an icon and a spinner state.

View the Sketch symbols either as a complete package, or as a starting point. Itâ€™s up to you guys. Since the developer gets all the source code, any tweaks you make to the designs will be pretty easy to implement in code.

Download the Sketch file to get started.


## 3. Sizes

![Available button styles](/Documentation/3.png)

There are two sizes, regular and small. It's generally a good idea to keep two distinct button sizes. Of course you can tweak the size as you see fit, and your developer can easily update the height of the 'Regular' and 'Small' size. You could also add a third size should you choose to, and your developer will be able to implement that easily too. 

The default heights are `50` and `40` points.



# Developers

The kit comes in a Swift Package with a single class that supports all variations of the design. Since you get all the source code, you can implement any tweaks you need.

Instantiate a button to your project either by placing a view in Interface Builder and changing its class to `Button`, or programmatically through ðŸ‘‡

````
public convenience init(width: CGFloat, color: UIColor?, style: Button.Style?, size: Button.Size?)
````
or the quicker convenience initðŸ‘‡ 

````
public convenience init(width: CGFloat, text: String?, color: UIColor?, style: Button.Style?, size: Button.Size?, block: (() -> Void)?)
````

You can edit the appearance of buttons either directly in Interface Builder or programmatically. The things you can tweak include ðŸ‘‡

* Text (duh)
* Detail text
* Icon
* Text color
* Border color
* Border width
* Corner radius
* Edge padding (for certain layouts)
* Size - regular or small
* Style - Filled, bordered, plain or destructive
* Layout - Regular, detail in center, detail to the right, icon

These parameters makes the `Button` class highly customisable.


## 1. Styles

![Available button styles](/Documentation/1.png)

### Primary
Requries no action in IB, instantiate with nil for the style parameter programmatically.

### Secondary
Set the `isBordered`* property to true in IB or instantiate with the bordered style programmatically.

### Plain
Set the `isPlain`* property to true in IB or instantiate with the plain style programmatically.

### Destructive
Set the `isDestructive`* property to true in IB or instantiate with the destructive style programmatically.

*Since @IBInspectable doesnâ€™t support enums, or any type of arrays, the style settings in Interface Builder needs to be boolean values, unfortunately.


## 2. Layouts

![Available button styles](/Documentation/2.png)

### Regular
The default layout. 

### detailRight
Set the `detailText` property in either IB or programmatically.

### detailCenter
Set the `detailText` property and the `isCenterred` property to true in either IB or programmatically.

### Icon
Specify an icon image with a `UIImage` object. This overrides any `detailText`. Set it in either IB or programmatically.

### Spinner
Call `startSpinner()` to enter spinner mode. `stopSpinner()` exits.


## 3. Sizes

![Available button styles](/Documentation/3.png)

There are two sizes, regular and small. The `isSmallSize` property creates a small sized button. Either through Interface Builder or programmatically. 

The default heights are `50` and `40` points. In case your designer wants to change those values, you can make the changes in the `Size` enum. All buttons in the project will adjust their frame height.

````
public enum Size: CGFloat {

    case regular = 50.0 // Change to update regular height
    case small = 40.0 // Change to update small height
}
````

To implement a third size, simply add another case, for example `mini` with `30` as value. Just note that this won't be supported in Interface Builder, only programmatically.


## 4. Adding an action

Actions can be implemented either by using the `selectionBlock` or by setting a delegate. Blocks are the recommended easiest way.

````
defaultButton.selectionBlock = {

    print("did tap button")
}
````

Implementing the `ButtonSelectionDelegate` protocol and set the `selectionDelegate` property on the button.

````
extension ViewController: ButtonSelectionDelegate {

    func didTapButton(_ button: Button) {
        
        print("didTapButton")
    }
}
````

````
defaultButton.selectionDelegate = self
````



# Getting the Code

![Available button styles](/Documentation/4.png)

The code comes in a Swift Package. In Xcode, select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Packade Depencyâ€¦`

The Package Repository is located at ðŸ‘‡

`https://github.com/tobberacing/ButtonsKit.git`

This will download and add the source code to your project in a `ButtonsKit` module.




# Examples


sd

![Available button styles](/Documentation/5.png)

For a simple button with regular size and regular layout, only a width is needed to init. `text`, `selectionBlock` and other parameters can be set later.

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, color: nil, style: nil, size: nil)

defaultButton.text = "Done"
````

A quicker init function lets you specify both `text` and the `selectionBlock` at creation. This lets you create a more complete button, with one line of code, that still allows a lot of flexibility.  

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, text: "Done", color: nil, style: nil, size: nil) {

    print("didSelect")

}
````



![Available button styles](/Documentation/6.png)

To turn this regular layout into one with a detail text in left/right layout, set the `detailText` property.

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, text: "Publish", color: nil, style: nil, size: nil) {

    print("didSelect")

}

defaultButton.detailText = "Global"
````


![Available button styles](/Documentation/7.png)

To create a button with detail text but a centerred layout, also set the `isCenterred` property.

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, text: "Purchase", color: nil, style: nil, size: nil) {

    print("didSelect")

}

defaultButton.detailText = "30 days free trial"
defaultButton.isCenterred = true
````


![Available button styles](/Documentation/8.png)

To create a button with an icon and left/right layout, set the `iconImage` with a `UIImage` object.

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, text: "Refresh", color: nil, style: nil, size: nil) {

    print("didSelect")

}

defaultButton.iconImage = UIImage(named: "Refresh white")
````

![Available button styles](/Documentation/9.png)

To create a destructive button, set the `isDestructive` to `true`.

````
let defaultButton = Button(width: 200, text: "Delete", color: nil, style: nil, size: nil) {

    print("didSelect")

}

defaultButton.isDestructive = true
````


# Global Settings


To keep coherent styling across all buttons in your project, some settings are defined as `static`. This includes fonts, destructive color and iconSize. Corner radius will be overriden if a static property is set. Tweak these values as you guys see fit.

````
static public var destructiveColor = UIColor(hex: "FB0002")
static public var destructiveTextColor = UIColor(hex: "FFFFFF")

static public let regularFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)
static public let smallFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 16, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)

static public let regularDetailFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 16, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)
static public let smallDetailFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 14, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)
static public let regularCenterredDetailFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)
static public let smallCenterredDetailFont = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 10, weight: UIFont.Weight.bold)

static public let iconSize = CGSize(width: 30, height: 30)

static public let regularCornerRadius: CGFloat?
static public let smallCornerRadius: CGFloat?
````

A default color can be set per-button. It will be used for text, fill and borders when no values have been explicitly set.

````
public var defaultColor = UIColor(hex: "293440") // overridable in instances by setting individual colors
````

Sizes can be changed across all buttons in your project by tweaking the `Size` enum values.

````
public enum Size: CGFloat {

    case regular = 50.0 // Change to update regular height
    case small = 40.0 // Change to update small height
}
````
